    <h1>MUSIC</h1><img src="/Image1.jpg">
    <p align=" left" color:rgb(236, 177, 89) background-color:rgb(140, 185, 189)>Music is the arrangement of sound to
        create
        some combination of form,
        harmony, melody, rhythm, or
        otherwise expressive content.[1][2][3] However, definitions of music vary depending on culture,[4] though it is
        an aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.[5] While scholars agree that music is defined by a
        few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions.[6] The creation of music is commonly
        divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance,[7] though the topic itself
        extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic contexts. Music may be
        performed using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice to sing, and thus is often credited for
        its extreme versatility and opportunity for creativity.[8]

        In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in
        Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and
        using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz, the performers may take turns leading and responding while sharing a
        changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting
        at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable or agglomerated electronically from
        many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock
        concerts, and orchestra performances, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV
        show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player, and a
        universal feature of radios and smartphones.

        Besides just entertainment, music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, rite of
        passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The music industry includes songwriters, performers,
        sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music.
        Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and
        music scholars, as well as amateurs.</p> <br>
    <h2>Etymology and terminology</h2>
    <p> <img src="/585px-Muses_sarcophagus_Louvre_MR880.jpg">

        The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s.[9] It is derived from a long line of
        successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th
        century; and the Latin mūsica.[10][8][n 1] The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké
        (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses" .[10][n 2] The Muses were nine deities in
        Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.[13][14] They were included in tales by the
        earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,[15] and eventually came to be associated with music
        specifically.[14] Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses.[11]
        The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via spelling
        and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian
        musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.[14] The modern
        Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term used to describe diverse genres, styles, and
        traditions.[16] This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern Indonesian (musik) and Shona
        (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, as they did not have words that
        fit exactly the Western scope.[14] Before Western contact in East Asia, neither Japan nor China had a single
        word that encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally, they often regarded music in such a
        fashion.[17] The closest word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning joy, and
        originally referred to all the arts before narrowing in meaning.[17] Africa is too diverse to make firm
        generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's often inseparable
        connection to dance and speech in general.[18] Some African cultures, such as the Songye people of the
        Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception
        of 'music' but no corresponding word in their native languages.[18] Other words commonly translated
        as 'music' often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music,
        sangita, properly refers to art music,[19] while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words
        for music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless.[20] Though the Arabic
        musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while khandan
        identifies vocal and improvised music.[21]
